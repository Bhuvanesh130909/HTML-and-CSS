    <hr>
    <pre>SQL has been around since the 1970s, and was standardized by the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) in 1986. Since then, SQL has become the most widely used language for managing relational databases and has undergone several revisions to keep pace with the evolving needs of the database industry.
